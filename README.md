# CS:GO Config
Just my CS:GO config...

For now, the config and video files should be placed into (depending on application installation drive):

### Windows
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\<steam_account_id>\730\local\cfg`

### macOS
`~/Library/Application\ Support/Steam/SteamApps/common/Counter-Strike\ Global\ Offensive/csgo/cfg/`

### Linux
`~/.steam/steam/SteamApps/common/Counter-Strike\ Global\ Offensive/csgo/cfg/`

## Launch params used

## Todo
- Mouse settings
